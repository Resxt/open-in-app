# open-in-app
A Powercord plugin that allows you to open links to their appropriate apps!

## Installation
To install this plugin go to your plugins directory and clone it with the command below.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Killerjet101/open-in-app.git
```

## Supported Apps
- [x] Spotify
- [x] Tidal
- [x] Steam
- [ ] Epic Games
- [ ] Origin
- [ ] Twitch

## Configuration
By default all the listed apps will open in the desktop application but if you want to always open certain links in the browser you can easily do that.  
For this go to your Discord settings, go down to plugins, click on `OpenInApp` and toggle off any app that you don't want to open in the desktop app.  
Having it on will open corresponding links in the desktop app and having it off will open the corresponding links like before.
